- Finish implementation of SauceData module
- Convert all subcommands to use SauceData.  Also redo aws client creation
    billing (very tricky.  Will require implementation of column reordering and truncation)
- Fix logging
- Implement terminal width formatting and truncation in SauceData
- sgstatus is failing when DescribeGatewayInformation is called against a stopped gateway.  Apparent
  cause is an incorrect display of status information from describedgateways
- Passing configuration data into SauceData needs a rework.  It's inconsistent and inefficient, 
  requiring that each command be touched every time there's an update to the SauceData object.
- migrate remaining standalone commands
- inject some sanity into how the various modules are built and imported.  Lots of legacy cruft from
  different scripts being smooshed together.
